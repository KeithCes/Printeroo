Bugs:
-taxes occasionally round to liek infinte decimal

Things to do at some point:
-orders shoudl be sorted by date on orders placed page


Things to think about before release:
-stock photos: where we get them, what they are
-should we show totalCost as tax + cost of items or just items (show correct data in db, stripe, order placed page, order confirm page)
